## Minutes for AGM 2020

Ian read the minutes for the 2020 AGM that had been held on 25 January
2021.

Peter moved the minutes be accepted as an accurate record of the
meeting. Rod seconded. Unanimous vote in favour.

## President's Report

Peter thanked our sponsors for 2021:

-   The head of the school of Computing and Mathematical Sciences,
    associate professor Annika Hinze, for sponsoring the meeting room
    again. Due to Covid lockdowns, some meetings were held online.

-   *RimuHosting* for providing the hosting of our web-site.

-   Daniel Lawson for providing hosting for the WLUG wiki.

-   NZ Open Source Society (NZOSS) for allowing us to use their Big Blue
    Button website to have video conferencing during the Covid19
    lock-down. The BBB software was recently upgraded.

-   Tony, Jeff and Rod, for providing the refreshments when we had
    meetings at MS4.G.02.

On a sad note, Ian Young passed away in 2021.

John Thompson was very ill at the end of the year. After treatment in
hospital John now seems to be recovering OK.

Our membership remained at 11. Although we dropped one member, but added
a new member.

The presentations at meetings included:

-   Syncthing
-   Fast Reverse Proxy
-   Embedded BASIC in LibreOffice
-   Nextcloud
-   Introduction to GIT
-   Linux intro evening
-   Home Assistant for home automation
-   Video processing
-   Xen server virtualization software

Attendance at meetings was lower than the year before. The virtual
meetings didn't help the attendence numbers. Not as many students as we
hoped for. Of the 11 meetings in the year, four of them were virtual.
The virtual meetings were recorded.

*GetTogether* wasn't used. However it is still running. Most people
find us through Meetup.com. Continue using Meetup.com as price seems to
be about constant. Plan to drop using *GetTogether*.

As BBB can now be recorded, and recordings may be extracted as mp4
files. Plan to add the recordings to our youtube channel.

There was a plan to move the wiki data, like the AGM minutes, to a WLUG
github.io website. However no progress was made on making this move.

Peter moved that President's report be accepted. Rod seconded.
Unanimously accepted.

## Treasurer's Report

Ian prepared and presented the Treasurer's Report. We had a small
profit for the year. Our regular expenses are the continuing of our
domain name registration and use of Meetup.com.

Our financial year continues to be from 1st January to 31st December.

Ian moved the Treasurer's Report be accepted and Chris seconded.
Unanimously agreed.

## Election of Committee for 2022

The following Officers were re-elected. There were no changes from 2021.

## Officers:

-   President: Peter Reutemann.
-   Vice President: Chris O'Halloran.
-   Treasurer: Tony Templer.
-   Secretary: Ian Stewart.

Peter contacted Lawerence and Roger by e-mail and they replied that they
agreed to be on the Committee again. Tom offered to be a replacement for
Jacob.

## Committee:

-   Roger Hardy.
-   Lawrence D'Oliverio.
-   Tom Butz.

Peter proposed the Officers and Committee. Chris seconded. Unanimously
agreed.

## General Business Agenda

1.  *RimuHosting* recently migrated the machine running our website to
    another virtual machine without any problems.

2.  Migrating some of the *RimuHosting* and Wiki material to github.io.
    Look at possibly having a CNAME for our current domain to point to
    wlug.github.io.

3.  Ian will set up a wlug.github.io Nikola website as a start as
    replacement of important content on *RimuHosting* and the Wiki. May
    need to talk to Daniel about keeping Wiki as a static website.

4.  Peter to check with lecturers on what they use for applications. Try
    to promote meetings that use open source and appeal to the Uni
    students.

5.  Aim to have meetings which are held at MS4.G.02 to also be on BBB.

## Meeting:

The AGM concluded at 8:48 pm.
