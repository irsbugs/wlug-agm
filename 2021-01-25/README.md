## Minutes for AGM 2019

The minutes for the 25 November 2019 AGM were read.

Peter moved the minutes be accepted as a true and correct record of the
meeting. Rod seconded. Unanimous vote

## President's Report

Peter thanked our sponsors for 2020. These were Professor David
Bainbridge, Waikato University Computer Science Dept., for providing the
meeting room. *RimuHosting* for providing the hosting of our web-site and
Daniel Lawson for providing hosting for the WLUG wiki.

Also thanked were our members Tony, Jeff and Rod, for continuing to
provide the beverages and snacks at our meetings.

Also thanks to NZ Open Source society for allowing us to use the Big
Blue Button website to have video conferencing during the Covid19
lock-down.

Possibly in the future we could broadcast our meetings for those that
are unable to attend. Also, look into video recording of the meetings.

A variety of presentations were delivered at our 2020 meetings and
topics included: LISP block chain, Wireguard VPN new-kid-on-the-block,
Pine Book Pro, Android ROM flashing, virtual examination of various
distros (GhostBSD, EndeavourOS, Ubuntu, Manjaro). Review of Naomi
Personal Voice Assistant. An intro to LISP.

Ran *GetTogether* in parallel with *Meetup.com*. No new uptake with
*GetTogether*. Run *GetTogether* for another year and evaluate. See if
*Meetup.com* changes their pricing.

Successfully changed the date for the AGM to January and registered this
with Incorporated Societies.

School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences were OK with sponsoring
the room for the 2021 year. They would like us to attract more Uni
students to come to WLUG meetings.

Members dropped from 12 to 11.

Peter moved that President's report be adopted and Roger agreed.

## Treasurer's Report

Ian prepared and presented the Treasurer's Report. We had a small loss
for the year. Our regular expenses are the continuing of our domain name
registration and use of Meetup.com.

Our financial year is from 1st January to 31st December. Last AGM we
agreed to change the AGM date to January so the Treasurer’s Report
accurately covers transactions from 1 Jan to 31 Dec. The AGM being in
January has been updated with the Incorporated Societies Register.

Ian moved the Treasurer's Report be accepted and Peter seconded.
Unanimously agreed.

## General Business Agenda

1. Review moving the AGM data from current Wiki to more secure
environment. Could use wlug.github.io as the website hosting of the
AGM's. Lawrence and Jacob will look into making these changes.

2. University Engagement. Promote Open Source software, particularly if
its cross-platform. University students tend to exclusively using the
Windows OS platform. E.g. Promote Blender and Inkscape applications, or
R and Python languages.
